Ball Launcher with IMU


Utilizes: ESP32, IMU, button, LCD 1.8" 

Description:
Using the IMU's accelerometer to launch the ball. By moving the embedded system, you will impart the initial trajectory on the ball. Kind of like for the Wii! 
Starting with a single ball somewhere on the screen (it's up to you to decide where it goes), when you want to start, you push and hold the button down. You then move the embedded system in a certain direction at a certain velocity/acceleration and when you release the button the ball should start moving in that direction based on your velocity at release.
