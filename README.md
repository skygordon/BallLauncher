Ball Launcher with IMU


Utilizes: ESP32, IMU, button, LCD 1.8" 

Description:
Using the IMU's accelerometer to launch the ball. By moving the embedded system, you will impart the initial trajectory on the ball. Kind of like for the Wii! 
Starting with a single ball somewhere on the screen, when you want to start, you push and hold the button down. You then move the embedded system in a certain direction at a certain velocity/acceleration and when you release the button the ball should start moving in that direction based on your velocity at release.
